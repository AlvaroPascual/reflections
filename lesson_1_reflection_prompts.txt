How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Bugs are introduced when we change something, so viewing the changes
makes easy to see what is wrong

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Because I can easily see all changes made and why they were made

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    pros: each commit has a meaning and is easier to understand
    cons: you may lose part of your work if you don't remember
to save it

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Because some logical changes imply changes in different files, so if
I want to commit changes with a meaning I may need to commit several files

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I view all commits with git log and I can see the changes with git diff

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can make changes without worrying because I always can go back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    For my software projects and TFM
